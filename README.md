# Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent

This is a implementation of the differentially private SGD optimizer described in the [Deep Learning with Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133) paper using an amortized accountant to keep track of used privacy. AmortizedAccountant accumulates the privacy spending by assuming all the examples are processed uniformly at random, so the spending is amortized among all the examples. Implementation is done in Tensorflow 2.3.

Note: The scripts will be slow without CUDA enabled.

## Requirements
python>=3.6
tensorflow>=2.0

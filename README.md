# Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent

This is partly the reproduction of the paper of [Deep Learning with Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133)   
Implementation is done in Tensorflow 2.3.

Note: The scripts will be slow without CUDA enabled.

## Requirements
python>=3.6  
tensorflow>=2.0

## Data
Currently only supports the MNIST dataset.
